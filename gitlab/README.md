## GitLab Wiki:

**GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform that allows teams to collaborate, manage, and automate their development workflows**. It offers features such as version control (`powered by Git`), (`CI/CD`) pipelines, issue tracking, and project management, all in one place.**created by Sid Sijbrandij, Dmitriy Zaporozhets, and the wider GitLab community. Initially written in Ruby and later expanded with Go**, 

GitLab helps teams manage every aspect of the software development lifecycle, from version control to deployment. In addition to Git-powered version control, **GitLab provides integrated tools like (`CI/CD`) pipelines, issue tracking, project management, Docker container registry, and monitoring**. GitLab also supports a vast range of **integrations including Kubernetes, Jira, Jenkins, Prometheus, and Slack, enabling teams to customize their workflows**.

**GitLab is available as both open-source (`under the MIT license`) and in enterprise versions, providing scalability for organizations of any size**. The SaaS version allows easy cloud hosting, while the self-hosted version ensures full control over infrastructure.

## Version Control & CI/CD:

- GitLab's version control system is powered by Git and includes advanced features like branch management, merge requests, and code reviews. It enables teams to collaborate on code changes in real-time. GitLab’s (`CI/CD`) pipelines allow automated testing, building, and deployment of code across development environments, ensuring faster feedback loops and fewer errors.

## Development & Language Support:

- Written primarily in Ruby, with some components built using Go.
Supports a wide variety of programming languages including Python,Java, JavaScript, Go, C/C++, Ruby, and more, making it adaptable to a range of project types.


## Security & Compliance:

- ***Container & Infrastructure Security*** - With Kubernetes integration, GitLab ensures the security of containerized applications by scanning containers for vulnerabilities and monitoring infrastructure.
- ***Access Control*** - Secure access through role-based permissions, allowing fine-grained control over who can view or edit specific aspects of a project.
- ***Audit Logs*** - Keeps detailed logs of activities to ensure compliance with regulatory standards like (`GDPR`), (`HIPAA`), and (`PCI-DSS`).
- ***CI/CD Pipelines Security*** - GitLab offers built-in security scanning tools (`SAST` &`DAST`) that check for vulnerabilities in the codebase during development.
- ***Data Encryption*** - Both in-transit and at-rest encryption is supported, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
- ***SAST (Static Application Security Testing)*** - Scans code for vulnerabilities as it's being written, allowing developers to fix issues early.
- ***DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)*** - Tests running applications for security flaws, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (`XSS`), and more.
- ***Dependency Scanning*** - Checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies and open-source libraries used in the project.

## Compliance Features:

- ***Data Encryption*** - GitLab ensures that data is protected both in-transit and at-rest, using industry-standard encryption mechanisms.
- ***Compliance Dashboard*** - Provides visibility into security and compliance postures across the entire development lifecycle, helping organizations meet regulatory requirements.
- ***Custom Approval Workflows*** - Allows teams to define custom workflows for code approval, ensuring compliance with organizational policies before code is merged.

## Key Features:

- ***Built-in CI/CD*** - Automates the entire software delivery pipeline, from code testing to production deployment.
- ***Container Registry*** - Securely manage Docker images right within GitLab.
- ***Merge Requests*** - Simplifies code collaboration with built-in code review and approvals.
- ***DevSecOps*** - Incorporates security checks (`SAST`, `DAST`, `dependency scans`) directly into the CI pipeline, enhancing security without sacrificing speed.
- ***Metrics & Monitoring*** - Provides real-time feedback on application performance and infrastructure health with Prometheus and other monitoring tools.

## Important Note:

- (`Do NOT`) overlook the importance of regular updates. Outdated GitLab instances may expose vulnerabilities, risking project integrity. Always keep GitLab and its plugins/extensions up-to-date to ensure compatibility and security.

## Best Practices:

- ***Regular Backups*** - Ensure regular automated backups of the GitLab instance to avoid data loss in case of system failures or migration needs.
- ***Branch Protection*** - Use protected branches to safeguard critical branches (such as main or production) from unintended direct pushes.
- ***Security Scans*** - Set up automatic security scans like SAST and DAST to continuously monitor and protect the codebase.
- ***CI/CD Optimization*** - Regularly review CI/CD pipelines to reduce build times and increase the overall efficiency of the development process.
- ***Use Secrets*** Store sensitive data like API keys and passwords securely using GitLab’s built-in secret management features.


##
> One cool feature of GitLab is its Auto DevOps. Auto DevOps automatically configures the CI/CD pipelines, security scans, and deployments based on your project’s code. By detecting the language and framework, it provides automatic pipeline templates, drastically reducing setup time for new projects while enforcing best practices.
