## Abstraction:

- Abstract the entire event planning process by focusing only on the core tasks. In the context of a GitLab CI/CD process, the focus will be on automating key tasks that ensure the event runs smoothly. This includes automating ticket sales, security management, schedule updates, and guest management, while leaving out non-essential tasks like decorations or minor logistical details.
Abstracted Tasks:

  - Ticket Sales & Registration Automation
  - Security Protocol Automation
  - Event Schedule Deployment
  - VIP & Guest Management Automation


## Decomposition:

- Break down each of the abstracted tasks into smaller components that can be automated using GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Each of these steps is essential to the success of the event but can be handled individually through a pipeline.
Decomposed Tasks:

- Ticket Sales & Registration:
  - Setup a ticketing platform using a pipeline to deploy the infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Automate attendee registration by deploying an online registration system.
- Security & Safety Protocols:
  - Automate security scans and compliance checks through GitLab’s CI tools.
  - Set up an access control system that automates guest check-ins.
- Event Schedule:
  - Automate the deployment of event schedules to the website or mobile app.
  - Set up automated reminders for important schedule updates and timing.
- Guest & VIP Management:
  - Automate the process of sending invitations, tracking responses, and managing VIP accommodations.


## Classification Patterns:

 - Classify the different tasks into categories that share similarities in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
Classified Patterns:

- Infrastructure Setup (Ticketing Platform, Registration System)
- Security and Compliance (Safety Checks, Guest Access Control)
- Content Management (Event Schedule, Notifications)
- Logistics and Guest Management (Invitations, VIP Handling)
- Pattern Identification:

- Identify patterns in the way different events (e.g., concerts, conferences, sports games) can be automated using similar GitLab CI/CD pipelines.


## Identified Patterns:

- Crowd-centric Events (Concerts, Sports Games): These events focus heavily on crowd management, ticketing, and security, which can be automated through security and ticketing pipelines.
- Speaker-centric Events (Conferences): These events require more focus on scheduling, speaker management, and logistics, which can be automated through schedule deployment and VIP handling pipelines.


## Example Table for Classification:

- Example Table for Classification:
- Event Type	Shared Organizational Tasks	CI/CD Patterns
- Concert	Ticketing, security, crowd control	Infrastructure, security, notifications
- Sports Game	Ticketing, security, vendor management	Infrastructure, security, vendor onboarding
- Conference	Scheduling, registration, VIP management	Content management, scheduling, guest logistics


> This Chain of steps—starting with abstraction, moving through decomposition, and then identifying patterns—the event planning process is greatly simplified and automated using GitLab CI/CD, leading to efficiency and error reduction in the event management process. I open for questions :)
