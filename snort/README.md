## Snort Wiki:

**Snort is a widely-used open-source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that detects and prevents network intrusions by analyzing network traffic in real-time. Developed by Martin Roesch and maintained by Cisco.** Snort is **written in C and is released under the GNU General Public License (`GPL`)**, enabling both personal and commercial use. 

**Snort utilizes a robust set of rules to identify malicious activities, generating alerts or blocking harmful packets. Snort is versatile, serving as a packet sniffer, logger, or a full-fledged IPS.** It supports various deployment options, including inline mode for active prevention.

## the two main offers for rule sets are:

  - ***Community Ruleset*** -  Freely available and developed by the community.
  - ***Snort Subscriber Ruleset*** - Maintained by Cisco Talos, providing real-time updates to subscribers.


## Security & Compliance:

- Snort assists in achieving compliance with security standards like (`PCI-DSS`) by monitoring network traffic for policy violations and potential threats. It ensures that organizations adhere to regulatory requirements by providing detailed audit logs and real-time alerts, crucial for maintaining compliance.

## Important Note:
- Do NOT overlook the importance of updating Snort rules regularly. Using outdated rules can lead to false positives or missed detections, compromising network security. Always ensure that your Snort rules are up-to-date to effectively identify and mitigate threats.


## Key Features:
- ***Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)*** - Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and can block or alert on potential threats.
- ***Packet Sniffer*** - Functions like tcpdump, capturing network packets for analysis.
- ***Packet Logger*** - Logs network packets, useful for traffic debugging and analysis.
- ***Custom Rule Creation*** - Allows users to define specific rules to detect unique threats.
- ***Scalability*** - Suitable for various network sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises.


## Best Practices:

- ***Rule Management*** - Regularly update your Snort rules to ensure optimal security.
- ***Network Segmentation*** - Use Snort with network segmentation to isolate and protect critical infrastructure.
- ***Performance Tuning*** - Optimize Snort's performance by adjusting configurations for your specific network environment.
- ***Monitoring & Logging*** - Continuously monitor Snort's performance and logs to stay ahead of threats.
- ***Backup Configurations*** - Regularly back up Snort configurations to prevent data loss and simplify recovery.

> One of the coolest aspects of Snort is its Community Ruleset, which is developed and maintained by a global community of security experts. This collaborative approach ensures that Snort stays updated with the latest threat intelligence, making it a powerful and dynamic tool for intrusion prevention.
