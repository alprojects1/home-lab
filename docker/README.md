### Docker Wiki:

**Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers.** Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

**Docker was originally developed by **Solomon Hykes as an internal project within dotCloud and released to the public in March 2013 and is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.** It has since evolved and become the cornerstone of many modern DevOps and continuous integration/continuous deployment (`CI/CD`) processes.rce 

**Docker is open-source however, for commercial use of Docker Engine obtained via Docker Desktop within larger enterprises (`exceeding 250 employees OR with annual revenue surpassing $10 million USD`), a paid subscription is required.** The CLI uses Docker APIs to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

 > By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

 ## Security & Compliance Requirements:

- Ensuring the security of Docker containers involves multiple layers, including the host operating system, Docker daemon configuration, and container configurations. Some key practices are:
  
    - ***Host Security*** The security of Docker containers is closely tied to the security of the host operating system. Use a minimal host OS, apply regular updates, and configure it according to security best practices.
    - ***Docker Daemon Configuration*** Secure the Docker daemon by configuring it to use TLS for communication, limiting access to the Docker API, and running it with the least privileges necessary.
    - ***Namespace Isolation*** Docker uses namespaces to provide isolation between containers. Ensure that containers run with the appropriate namespaces to prevent unauthorized access to resources
    - ***Immutable Containers & Regular Audits*** Build containers to be immutable by minimizing the use of writable layers. This ensures that containers are not modified at runtime, also conduct regular security audits of Docker configurations and containers. Use tools like Docker Bench for Security to check for compliance with best practices.
    - ***Network Security*** Use Docker's network features to create isolated networks for containers. Configure firewalls and network policies to control traffic between containers and external systems.
    - ***Compliance*** Ensure that Docker configurations and practices comply with relevant regulatory requirements (`GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2`) by implementing appropriate security controls and maintaining thorough documentation and audit trails.

### Best Practices:

- When working with Docker, it's crucial to follow best practices to ensure security, efficiency, and maintainability. Best practices are essential for maintaining a secure, efficient, and reliable containerized environment. IT professionals can ensure their Docker deployments are robust and manageable. Here are the key practices:
  
    - ***Use Official Images*** Always start with official base images from trusted sources like Docker Hub. This reduces security risks and ensures you are working with well-maintained and regularly updated images. https://www.linuxserver.io/
    - ***Minimize Image Size*** Keep Docker images small by using lightweight base images and multi-stage builds. Smaller images are easier to manage, deploy, and have a smaller attack surface.
    - ***Avoid Running as Root*** Configure containers to run as non-root users. Running as root inside a container can pose significant security risks if the container is compromised.
    - ***Regularly Update Images and Dependencies*** Ensure that base images and dependencies are regularly updated to include the latest security patches and improvements. This helps in mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
    - ***Use Volumes for Persistent Storage*** Use Docker volumes for persistent storage to ensure data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed. Volumes also make it easier to manage and back up data.
