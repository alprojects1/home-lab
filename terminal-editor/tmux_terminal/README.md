## Tmux Wiki:

(`short for terminal multiplexer`) is a powerful open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. **It's used to manage multiple terminal sessions, create, access, and control multiple terminals (`or panes`) within a single screen.** It can also be used for **detaching processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible, making it a valuable tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone who frequently** works with the command line. 

**It was originally written by Nicholas Marriott in 2007. It is distributed under the ISC license, which is a permissive free software license. The development of tmux was motivated by the need for a modern, feature-rich terminal multiplexer that could serve as an alternative to the older GNU Screen.** This introduced several improvements over GNU Screen, such as a more flexible and user-friendly configuration system, better handling of multiple sessions and windows, and the ability to split windows into multiple panes. 

**The project is hosted on GitHub, where users can report issues, request features, and contribute to the codebase. The ongoing development ensures that it remains up-to-date with modern terminal capabilities and user needs.** In 2009 the first public release made available, and it quickly gained traction as a viable alternative to GNU Screen. 


## Key Features:

- ***Session Management*** - Allows users to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window. Sessions can be detached and reattached, enabling users to resume their work from where they left off.
- ***Window and Pane Management*** - Users can split terminal windows into multiple panes, either horizontally or vertically, and switch between them easily. This feature allows for efficient multitasking and organization of terminal-based workflows.
- ***Customizable Key Bindings*** - Tmux provides customizable key bindings and commands, enabling users to tailor the interface to their preferences and optimize their workflow.
- ***Persistence*** - Sessions remain active even if the user disconnects or logs out, allowing for persistent workflows that continue to run in the background.
- ***Scripting and Automation*** - Supports scripting and automation, enabling users to create complex setups and automate repetitive tasks using configuration files and scripts.



## Besy Practice:

- ***Organize Workspaces*** - Use Tmux to create and manage distinct workspaces for different tasks or projects. This helps keep your terminal environment organized and efficient.
- ***Leverage Key Bindings*** - Customize Tmux key bindings to match your workflow and improve navigation speed. Familiarize yourself with default bindings and consider setting up your own.
- ***Utilize Sessions*** - Make use of Tmux sessions to manage long-running processes or remote work. Detach and reattach sessions as needed to maintain a continuous workflow.
- ***Automate Setup*** - Use Tmux configuration files to automate the setup of your terminal environment, including window and pane arrangements, to streamline your workflow.
- ***Monitor Resources*** - Integrate Tmux with monitoring tools to keep track of system performance or running processes directly from your Tmux session.

> by 2011 tmux was adopted by several Unix-like operating systems' package managers, making it more accessible to a broader user base. In 2014, major enhancements were made to improve performance, configuration flexibility, and compatibility with modern terminal features. By 2018 The project saw significant contributions from new developers, leading to the introduction of new features and improvements. I am on version 3.2a as of writing.
