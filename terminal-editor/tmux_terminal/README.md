**tmux (`short for terminal multiplexer`) is a powerful open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It's used to manage multiple terminal sessions, create, access, and control multiple terminals (`or panes`) within a single screen.** It can also be used for detaching processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible, making it a valuable tool for system administrators, developers, and anyone who frequently works with the command line. 

**It was originally written by Nicholas Marriott in 2007. It is distributed under the ISC license, which is a permissive free software license. The development of tmux was motivated by the need for a modern, feature-rich terminal multiplexer that could serve as an alternative to the older GNU Screen.** This introduced several improvements over GNU Screen, such as a more flexible and user-friendly configuration system, better handling of multiple sessions and windows, and the ability to split windows into multiple panes. 

The project is hosted on GitHub, where users can report issues, request features, and contribute to the codebase. The ongoing development ensures that it remains up-to-date with modern terminal capabilities and user needs. In 2009 the first public release made available, and it quickly gained traction as a viable alternative to GNU Screen. 

> by 2011 tmux was adopted by several Unix-like operating systems' package managers, making it more accessible to a broader user base. In 2014, major enhancements were made to improve performance, configuration flexibility, and compatibility with modern terminal features. By 2018 The project saw significant contributions from new developers, leading to the introduction of new features and improvements. I am on version 3.2a as of writing.
