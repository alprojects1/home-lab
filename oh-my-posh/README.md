## Best Practice:

- ***Integrate with Git*** - Make use of Oh-My-Poshâ€™s git segment to display your current branch, status, and other git-related information for easier version control management.

 >Traditionally, prompt tools work with custom scripts per theme (`just like Oh My Posh 2 did`) or a lot of `CLI` configuration switches to define what it looks like. With Posh, it starts from a single configuration file that could easily be shared anywhere, removing the need to really grasp what goes on underneath.
