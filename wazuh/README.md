## Wazuh Wiki:

**Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring platform designed to provide comprehensive security visibility and compliance for your infrastructure. Wazuh helps organizations adhere to regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS by offering robust tools for security monitoring and compliance management. It integrates a variety of security components and offers Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) features, providing a comprehensive solution for threat,** such as (`intrusion detection`), (`log data analysis`), (`vulnerability detection`), and security information and event management (`SIEM`). Wazuh comprises three main components: the **Wazuh Manager**, **Wazuh Agent**, and **Wazuh Indexer**.

**Wazuh is its integration flexibility. Wazuh can be seamlessly integrated with various cloud environments, containers, and on-premise infrastructures, making it highly adaptable to diverse IT ecosystems.** Additionally, Wazuh's **open-source nature allows for extensive customization, which can be crucial for organizations with unique security needs.** It's also worth noting that **Wazuh provides active community support and regular updates,** ensuring that the platform evolves with emerging security threats and compliance requirements.

## Security & Compliance Managment:

- ***Audit Logs*** - Wazuh continuously tracks and logs user access to sensitive data, as well as system changes, providing an audit trail that is crucial for regulatory compliance.
- ***Policy Enforcement*** -  It ensures that all endpoints are in alignment with security policies and industry standards by automatically checking and enforcing compliance rules across the network.
- ***File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)*** - Wazuh monitors changes to critical files and directories, alerting administrators to unauthorized modifications, which is essential for maintaining compliance with regulations.
- ***Vulnerability Detection*** -  Wazuh identifies and reports vulnerabilities across the infrastructure, allowing organizations to take proactive steps to secure their systems and stay compliant with industry standards.

## Key Features:

- ***Extended Detection and Response (`XDR`)***
Wazuh’s XDR capabilities extend beyond traditional security tools by integrating data from multiple sources—endpoints, networks, and servers—into a unified threat detection and response system. This allows for the following:

  - ***Comprehensive Threat Detection*** - Wazuh correlates security events from various sources, providing in-depth threat analysis.
  - ***Automated Response*** - XDR allows Wazuh to automatically respond to detected threats, reducing the time between detection and mitigation.
  - ***Advanced Analytics*** - XDR in Wazuh leverages machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect sophisticated threats that might bypass traditional security measures.
 
- ***Security Information and Event Management (`SIEM`)***
  Wazuh’s SIEM capabilities offer centralized monitoring, analysis, and management of security events across an organization's infrastructure. This includes:

  - ***Event Correlation*** - Aggregates data from various sources, identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of security threats.
  - ***Log Management*** - Collects, stores, and analyzes logs from across your network, enabling real-time detection of threats.
  - ***Compliance Reporting*** - Assists in meeting regulatory requirements by generating detailed reports based on security events and log data.
 
## Important Note:

- **Do NOT** misconfigure agent enrollment settings. If agents are not correctly enrolled or if there's a mismatch in authentication tokens, it can lead to failed connections and gaps in security monitoring. Always verify that agent keys are securely stored and matched with the correct Wazuh Manager settings to ensure continuous and accurate data flow from all monitored endpoints. Additionally, avoid modifying system-level files or configurations without proper understanding, as this could disrupt critical security processes and compliance checks.

## Best Practices:

- ***Keep Components Updated*** - Ensure Wazuh Manager, Agent, and Indexer are always running the latest stable versions to avoid compatibility issues.
- ***Follow Official Documentation*** - Adhere strictly to the official Wazuh documentation during deployment and configuration for optimal security and functionality.
- ***Network Segregation*** - Segregate network traffic between Wazuh components to minimize the attack surface.
- ***Regular Policy Review*** -  Regularly update and review security policies to adapt to evolving threats.
- ***Log Management*** - Configure proper log rotation and storage to maintain long-term data availability and compliance.
