You can quickly categorize, escalate, or resolve alerts directly from the Inbox, streamlining your workflow and ensuring that no critical alerts slip through the cracks. This feature, combined with its user-friendly interface, makes EveBox a powerful tool for both proactive and reactive security operations.
