## Lm-Sensors:

**lm-sensors (`Linux-monitoring sensors`) is a free open-source powerful and versatile software tool, used for monitoring the temperature, voltage, humidity, chassis intrusions, and fan speeds of various hardware components in Linux systems.** It interacts with sensor chips built into motherboards and provides real-time data about system health, which can be crucial for diagnosing hardware issues and ensuring optimal performance.

**lm-sensors was originally created by Rudolf Marek and has been maintained and developed by various contributors over time.** The project is now managed by the lm-sensors development team, which includes volunteers and contributors from the open-source community. The tool is part of the Hardware Monitoring (`hwmon`) subsystem in the Linux kernel, and its development has involved contributions from numerous individuals who have worked on sensor chip support, kernel modules, and user-space utilities.

**This has since been dealt with, and the separate README file dedicated to ThinkPads was removed in 2007. In 2013, the sensors-detect command of lm-sensors began disrupting the gamma correction settings of some laptop display screens.** This occurs while it is probing the (`I2C/SMBus`) adapters for connected hardware monitoring devices. Probing of these devices was disabled by default.

## Key Features:

- ***Hardware Monitoring*** - lm-sensors provides real-time monitoring of hardware sensors, including temperature, voltage, and fan speeds.
- ***Compatibility*** - Supports a wide range of hardware, making it versatile for different systems.
- ***Alerting*** - Allows users to set thresholds for sensors and receive alerts when these are breached.
- ***Logging*** - Capable of logging sensor data for long-term monitoring and analysis.
- ***Integration*** - Can be integrated with other monitoring tools like `Grafana` and `Prometheus` for enhanced visualization and analysis.

## Best Practice:

- ***Regularly Update lm-sensors*** - Keep lm-sensors and its database updated to ensure compatibility with new hardware, unless compiled from source
- ***Initial Configuration*** - Run the initial configuration script to detect all available sensors. ■ `Command: sudo sensors-detect`
- ***Check Sensor Readings*** - Regularly check sensor readings to monitor hardware health. ■  `Command: sensors`
- ***Set Alerts*** - Configure alert thresholds for critical sensors to receive notifications of potential issues.
- ***Automate Monitoring*** - Integrate lm-sensors with other monitoring tools to automate the tracking of hardware metrics.
- ***Document Configuration*** - Keep a record of sensor configurations and any customizations for easy replication and troubleshooting.


> During 2001/2004, the lm_sensors package was not recommended for use on IBM ThinkPads due to potential (`EEPROM`) corruption issues on some models when aggressively probing for (`I2C`) devices.
